# Causal Inference Mixtape

Here are Jupyter notebooks with Python code for Scott Cunningham's _Causal Inference Mixtape_. This will be a slow project. 

So far, I'm trying to write simple procedural programs that replicate the provided R and Stata. I'm not making much use of Python being an object-oriented language or refactoring code to include once-used functions as long as the programs remain rather short.
